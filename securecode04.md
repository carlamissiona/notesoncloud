**ISO/IEC 12207 is an international standard for software life-cycle processes**


**Popular Agile methods include Rational Unified Process, Scrum, Crystal Framework, Extreme Programming, Adaptive Software Development**


### DevSecOps

**This includes the ff themes**

* Cloud security
 
* Continous monitoring 

* Security as Code

* Shift left - Shifting security “left” expresses that security activities are integrated into SDLC phases and even in the start or development etc, with continuous feedback at every stage 

**CMM**

**Capability maturity Model**

_The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is a methodology used to develop and refine an organization's process of software development. The model describes a five-level or evolutionary steps-path of increasingly mature software development processes._


* Understands that the quality of the software in its final form is associated with the quality of the software processes involved and its maintainance
