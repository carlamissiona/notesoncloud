## Notes on Secure Coding



### SDLC



**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to produce high quality softwares,  Software Development Process**


**ISO/IEC 12207 is an international standard for software life-cycle processes**


**Popular Agile methods include Rational Unified Process, Scrum, Crystal Framework, Extreme Programming, Adaptive Software Development**


### DevSecOps

DevSecOps is the framework that comprises spans the entire IT Team elements that includes network, host, container, server, cloud, the vaiours methods and application security  

**This includes the ff themes**

* Cloud security
 
* Continous monitoring 

* Security as Code

* Shift left - Shifting security “left” expresses that security activities are integrated into SDLC phases and even in the start or development etc, with continuous feedback at every stage 

**CMM**

**Capability maturity Model**

_The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is a methodology used to develop and refine an organization's process of software development. The model describes a five-level or evolutionary steps-path of increasingly mature software development processes._


* Understands that the quality of the software in its final form is associated with the quality of the software processes involved and its maintainance


<br>

**OWASP Has SAMM**

_Software Assurance Maturity Model_

  * A maturity model for software assurance that provides an effective and measurable way to analyze and improve the quality software security 
  
  * In other SAMM is a tool to evaluate an organization's existing software security practices




**Shifting right fails**

**When Shifting left an organization is placing  more security tools early on the phases of SDLC**

<br><br>
**Activities In SHIFT LEFT**
<br>

  **Security Requirements**


  **Example these are security requirements but policies may also follows shift left approach to secure software more**

   Security requirement—Application shall ensure that access to the report is limited to authenticated users of the organization that the dashboard-report belongs to.

   Security requirement—Application shall log information related to the admin accounts that create and change the dashboard-report details.



   **Threat Modeling**

   **Secure Code Review**

   **Scanning for OSS**

   **Testing With DAST**

   **Installing WAF and SEIM**
