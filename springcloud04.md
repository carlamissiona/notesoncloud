### Microservices Concepts 

* Single Responsibility Per Service - This is a principle of SOLID; Once business function per service 

* One Database per service

* The honeycomb analogy - the ideal microservice; a honeycomb unit is independent and still interconnected ; Errors or damage to one cell does not spread to another

* Microservices are autonomous and are deployed independently within a special runtime built for each

* Services are using endpoints to interact with outside world

* Microservices should be designed to be independent and loosely coupled. In most cases, microservices makes use of events and messages

* Services are composeable microservices are composeable through service orchestration or service choreography

* Microservices ought to be lightweight

* Microservices are maintained in a capable infrastructure that keeps its design or microservices principles

* Microservices should be challenged and it should expect failures

* SOA is similar to microservices in a way because microservices is business function centric and not monolithic

* Microservices decentralize data and logic ; microservices is about service building

* Twelve-Factor App, is being cloud-ready. These twelve factors are suited for microservices too
