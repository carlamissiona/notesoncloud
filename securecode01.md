### Secure Software Concepts

* **Secure Software Concepts**

* **Secure Software Concepts- Concepts from information security domain**

*  _**CIA**_ **common concepts in security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA).**

* **Confidentiality is the concept of preventing the exposure of information to unauthorized users.**

* **Confidentiality is also keeping secrets secret.Having Authorized parties makes the means there is authorization**  

* **Some methods of keeping data confidential:**

 1. Access controls
 2. Encryption

* **Factors to Apply or Implement Confidentiality Controls :**

 1. Failure to protect key
 2. Failure to use algorithms from approved cryptographic libraries [ Using own crypto, may lead to failure ] 
 3. Ask these questions :  - Who are the party authorized to see what specific data  - What mechanism should be employed to enforce confidentiality

* **Integrity much like confidentiality, integrity refers to protecting the data from unauthorized alteration. Users can be authorized to alter or view information 
  so integrity controls need authorization scheme to prevent controlling alterations, including deletions**
